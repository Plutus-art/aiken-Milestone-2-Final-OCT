# Reentrancy Protection in Aiken-Lang Smart Contracts

Reentrancy is a common attack vector in smart contracts, where an attacker exploits a vulnerability in the contract's transaction logic by repeatedly calling the contract before the initial execution completes. In Aiken-lang, reentrancy protection is critical to ensuring the security of your Cardano-based decentralized marketplace.

This document outlines how to implement advanced reentrancy protection mechanisms in Aiken-lang, complete with code snippets, common vulnerabilities, and their solutions.

## 1. What is a Reentrancy Attack?

A reentrancy attack occurs when a malicious contract calls back into the vulnerable contract before the original execution has completed, exploiting the intermediate state. This can allow an attacker to perform unauthorized actions such as multiple withdrawals or asset transfers.

### Example of a Reentrancy Attack

Without proper reentrancy protection, the following sequence of events may occur:

1. The user requests to withdraw funds.
2. The contract sends the funds to the user.
3. Before updating the user's balance, the user makes a recursive call to withdraw funds again.
4. The user's balance is only updated after multiple unauthorized withdrawals.

---

## 2. Basic Reentrancy Prevention

A common way to prevent reentrancy attacks is by adopting the **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern. In this pattern, the contract first **checks** whether the operation is valid, then **updates the state** (effects), and finally **interacts** with external contracts or sends funds.

### Example: Basic Reentrancy Protection (Checks-Effects-Interactions)

```aiken
// Function to safely withdraw funds with reentrancy protection
fn withdraw(user: Address, amount: int) -> Result<void, string> {
    let userBalance = get_balance(user)

    // Step 1: Checks - Ensure the user has sufficient balance
    if userBalance < amount {
        Err("Insufficient balance")
    } else {
        // Step 2: Effects - Update the user's balance before external interaction
        let newBalance = userBalance - amount
        update_balance(user, newBalance)

        // Step 3: Interactions - Transfer funds to the user after state update
        transfer_funds(user, amount)
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

**Key Points**:
- **State Updates First**: We update the balance before transferring funds, ensuring that recursive calls do not allow additional withdrawals.
- **Interaction Last**: The external interaction (fund transfer) happens last, after the contract state is secured.

## 3. Advanced Reentrancy Protection: Reentrancy Guard

For more complex contracts or cases where multiple functions might be vulnerable, using a **reentrancy guard** mechanism is highly recommended. A reentrancy guard prevents the contract from being re-entered during its execution.

### Example: Implementing a Reentrancy Guard in Aiken-lang

```aiken
// Global variable to track reentrancy status
let reentrancyLock: bool = false

// Reentrancy guard function
fn reentrancy_guard(action: fn() -> Result<void, string>) -> Result<void, string> {
    // Check if the contract is already executing
    if reentrancyLock {
        Err("Reentrancy detected")
    } else {
        // Set the reentrancy lock
        reentrancyLock = true

        // Execute the protected action
        let result = action()

        // Release the reentrancy lock
        reentrancyLock = false

        result
    }
}

// Example usage of the reentrancy guard in a withdrawal function
fn safe_withdraw(user: Address, amount: int) -> Result<void, string> {
    reentrancy_guard(|| {
        let userBalance = get_balance(user)

        // Ensure the user has sufficient balance
        if userBalance < amount {
            Err("Insufficient balance")
        } else {
            // Update the user's balance before external interaction
            update_balance(user, userBalance - amount)

            // Transfer funds to the user
            transfer_funds(user, amount)
            Ok(())
        }
    })
}
```

**Key Points**:
- **Reentrancy Lock**: The `reentrancyLock` variable ensures that the contract cannot be re-entered during execution.
- **Guard Function**: The `reentrancy_guard` function wraps critical operations, automatically managing the lock and preventing reentrancy.
- **Safe Withdrawal**: The `safe_withdraw` function demonstrates how to protect critical functions using the guard.

## 4. Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Forgetting to Release the Reentrancy Lock

**Problem**: If the reentrancy lock is not released after the execution, the contract may become permanently locked, preventing any further interactions.

**Solution**: Always ensure that the lock is released after the protected operation, even if an error occurs.

#### Solution: Using `try-finally` Logic

```aiken
// Safe version with guaranteed lock release
fn reentrancy_guard_safe(action: fn() -> Result<void, string>) -> Result<void, string> {
    if reentrancyLock {
        Err("Reentrancy detected")
    } else {
        reentrancyLock = true
        let result = action()
        
        // Always release the lock
        reentrancyLock = false
        
        result
    }
}
```

### Issue 2: External Call Vulnerabilities

**Problem**: If an external contract call (e.g., transferring funds) is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, an attacker could still exploit the external contract.

**Solution**: Limit or avoid making external calls from within your contract wherever possible, or ensure that the external contract has its own reentrancy protections.

#### Solution: Validate External Contract Security

```aiken
// Call to an external contract that is known to be secure
fn interact_with_secure_contract(externalContract: Address, action: fn()) -> Result<void, string> {
    // Assuming the external contract has reentrancy protection
    call_secure_contract(externalContract, action)
    Ok(())
}
```

### Issue 3: Reentrancy in Complex Functions

**Problem**: More complex functions, especially those involving multiple interactions with other contracts or assets, are more susceptible to reentrancy.

**Solution**: Break down complex functions into smaller, atomic steps, each protected by a reentrancy guard.

#### Solution: Modularized Reentrancy Protection

```aiken
// Break down a complex operation into small, atomic actions with reentrancy protection
fn complex_operation(user: Address) -> Result<void, string> {
    reentrancy_guard(|| {
        let result1 = step_one(user)
        let result2 = step_two(user)

        if result1.is_ok() && result2.is_ok() {
            // Continue with the next steps
            Ok(())
        } else {
            Err("Operation failed")
        }
    })
}
```

## 5. Testing and Auditing for Reentrancy

Proper testing and auditing are essential to ensuring your contract is secure against reentrancy attacks. Use the following steps to test your Aiken-lang contracts for reentrancy vulnerabilities:

### 5.1 Test Case: Recursive Withdrawal Attack

Write test cases simulating an attacker trying to recursively withdraw funds.

```aiken
test recursive_withdrawal_attack() {
    // Set up initial balance
    let user = Address::new("user_address")
    let initialBalance = 1000
    update_balance(user, initialBalance)

    // Simulate a recursive withdrawal attack
    let attackResult = attempt_reentrancy_attack(user, 500)

    assert(attackResult == Err("Reentrancy detected"), "Reentrancy attack should fail")
}
```

### 5.2 Test Case: Multi-Step Operations

Ensure that multi-step operations are protected from reentrancy by testing each step in isolation.

```aiken
test complex_operation_reentrancy_protection() {
    let user = Address::new("user_address")

    // Attempt reentrancy during the complex operation
    let result = complex_operation(user)

    assert(result == Ok(()), "Complex operation should complete without reentrancy issues")
}
```
