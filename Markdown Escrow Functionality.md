# Marketplace Functionality in Aiken-Lang

This guide covers core features for a Cardano-based NFT and token marketplace using Aiken-lang. It focuses on the following areas:

1. **Escrow Functionality**
2. **Offer Management**
3. **Dispute Resolution**
4. **Fee Management**

Each section includes old and new function implementations to showcase improvements in functionality.

---

## 1. Escrow Functionality

Escrow ensures assets are securely held until specific conditions are met, protecting both buyers and sellers in a marketplace transaction.

### Old Implementation: Simple Escrow

In the older version, escrow functionality relied on manually locking assets without additional validation or conditions, which was prone to issues.

```aiken
// Old Escrow Function: Lock funds until condition is met
fn escrow_simple(buyer: Address, seller: Address, amount: int, condition: bool) -> Result<void, string> {
    if condition {
        transfer(buyer, seller, amount)
        Ok(())
    } else {
        Err("Condition not met")
    }
}
```

**Issue:** 
- No dispute resolution mechanism if the condition fails.
- No time constraints or refund process.

### New Implementation: Escrow with Conditional Logic and Timeout

The new implementation introduces additional checks, timeouts, and dispute resolution support, making escrow transactions more robust.

```aiken
// New Escrow Function: Lock funds with condition and timeout
fn escrow_with_timeout(buyer: Address, seller: Address, amount: int, condition: bool, timeout: Time) -> Result<void, string> {
    let currentTime = get_current_time()

    if condition && currentTime <= timeout {
        transfer(buyer, seller, amount)
        Ok(())
    } else if currentTime > timeout {
        refund(buyer, amount)
        Err("Escrow expired, refunding buyer")
    } else {
        Err("Condition not met, waiting for resolution")
    }
}
```

**Improvements:**
- Adds a timeout for automatic refund if escrow conditions aren't met in time.
- Prevents indefinite lock-ups of funds.

## 2. Offer Management

Offer management allows users to create, modify, or cancel offers within the marketplace.

### Old Implementation: Basic Offer Creation

In the old system, offers could only be created without modification or cancellation capabilities, leading to inflexibility.

```aiken
// Old Offer Function: Create an offer
fn create_offer(seller: Address, asset: Asset, price: int) -> Offer {
    Offer {
        seller: seller,
        asset: asset,
        price: price,
        status: "Open"
    }
}
```

**Issue:** 
- No support for offer modification or cancellation.
- No control over offer statuses.

### New Implementation: Full Offer Management (Create, Modify, Cancel)

The updated version supports creating, modifying, and canceling offers, adding flexibility for marketplace users.

```aiken
// New Offer Function: Create, modify, or cancel offers
fn manage_offer(action: OfferAction, offer: Offer, new_price: Option<int>) -> Result<Offer, string> {
    match action {
        Create(seller, asset, price) -> 
            Ok(Offer { seller: seller, asset: asset, price: price, status: "Open" })

        Modify(offer, Some(new_price)) ->
            if offer.status == "Open" {
                Ok(offer { price: new_price })
            } else {
                Err("Offer cannot be modified, status is not Open")
            }

        Cancel(offer) ->
            if offer.status == "Open" {
                Ok(offer { status: "Cancelled" })
            } else {
                Err("Offer cannot be canceled, status is not Open")
            }
    }
}
```

**Improvements:**
- Allows offers to be modified or canceled based on their status.
- Ensures offers can't be modified or canceled after they've been accepted or expired.

## 3. Dispute Resolution

Dispute resolution is critical in resolving conflicts between buyers and sellers. Aiken-lang now supports basic dispute resolution mechanisms.

### Old Implementation: No Dispute Handling

In the old version, disputes weren't handled within the smart contract, requiring external mechanisms for resolution.

```aiken
// Old: No built-in dispute resolution
// All transactions were final after conditions were met or failed.
```

**Issue:**
- Lack of automated support for resolving buyer-seller conflicts.
- Required off-chain intervention.

### New Implementation: Dispute Resolution with Arbitration

The updated version adds dispute resolution mechanisms, including arbitration functions.

```aiken
// New Dispute Resolution: Arbitration support
fn resolve_dispute(dispute: Dispute, arbiter: Address) -> Result<void, string> {
    match dispute.status {
        "Pending" -> 
            if arbiter == dispute.arbiter {
                if dispute.decision == "Refund" {
                    refund(dispute.buyer, dispute.amount)
                } else if dispute.decision == "Complete" {
                    transfer(dispute.buyer, dispute.seller, dispute.amount)
                }
                Ok(())
            } else {
                Err("Unauthorized arbiter")
            }
        _ -> Err("No active dispute")
    }
}
```

**Improvements:**
- Introduces an arbitration process where disputes can be settled by a designated arbiter.
- Provides options for refunding or completing transactions based on the arbiterâ€™s decision.

## 4. Fee Management

Fees are essential in managing marketplace activities, such as listing and transaction fees.

### Old Implementation: Static Fee Collection

In the old system, fees were hardcoded and collected without flexibility, limiting custom fee structures.

```aiken
// Old Fee Function: Collect a flat fee for all transactions
fn collect_fee(amount: int) -> int {
    let fee = 10 // static fee
    amount - fee
}
```

**Issue:** 
- Static fees limit flexibility and scalability in the marketplace.

### New Implementation: Dynamic Fee Management

The new implementation supports dynamic fee calculation based on marketplace activities, such as percentage-based fees.

```aiken
// New Fee Management: Dynamic fee calculation
fn calculate_fee(amount: int, fee_rate: float) -> int {
    let fee = floor(fee_rate * amount)
    amount - fee
}

// Collect fees based on activity type (listing, transaction)
fn collect_fees(activity: ActivityType, amount: int) -> Result<int, string> {
    let fee_rate = match activity {
        Listing -> 0.02 // 2% fee for listings
        Transaction -> 0.01 // 1% fee for transactions
    }
    
    let net_amount = calculate_fee(amount, fee_rate)
    Ok(net_amount)
}
```

**Improvements:**
- Allows for dynamic fee structures (e.g., percentage-based fees).
- Differentiates fees based on activity type (e.g., listing vs transaction).
