# Rich Standard Library in Aiken-lang for Smart Contracts

Aiken-lang provides a **Rich Standard Library** that simplifies and enhances the development of smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. This library includes a wide range of pre-built functions and utilities, allowing developers to focus on building robust applications without reinventing the wheel.

## Features of the Rich Standard Library

1. **Data Structures**: 
   - Provides immutable data structures like lists, maps, and sets.
   - Built-in support for complex data types to represent NFTs, tokens, and user transactions.

2. **Mathematical Functions**:
   - Comprehensive set of mathematical functions for performing calculations, useful for pricing and rewards systems.

3. **String Manipulation**:
   - Functions for string handling, including concatenation, slicing, and formatting, essential for managing metadata.

4. **Validation Functions**:
   - Pre-defined functions to validate transactions, signatures, and contract states, ensuring compliance and security.

5. **Event Logging**:
   - Built-in logging functionalities for tracing contract events, which help in debugging and monitoring contract behavior.

## Code Snippets Using the Rich Standard Library

### 1. **Creating and Managing NFTs**

```aiken
-- Importing necessary modules from the Rich Standard Library
import List
import Map

-- Defining an NFT structure
type NFT = { id: Int, owner: PubKeyHash, metadata: String }

-- Function to create a new NFT
createNFT : PubKeyHash -> String -> NFT
createNFT owner metadata =
    let
        id = generateNFTId() -- Using a function from the library to generate a unique ID
    in
        { id = id, owner = owner, metadata = metadata }

-- Function to list NFTs owned by a specific user
listNFTsByOwner : PubKeyHash -> List NFT -> List NFT
listNFTsByOwner owner nfts =
    List.filter (\nft -> nft.owner == owner) nfts
```

### 2. **Mathematical Functions for Pricing**

```aiken
-- Function to calculate the total price of multiple NFTs
calculateTotalPrice : List Value -> Value
calculateTotalPrice prices =
    List.foldl (+) 0 prices  -- Using fold function to sum the list of prices

-- Function to apply a discount to a given price
applyDiscount : Value -> Float -> Value
applyDiscount price discountPercent =
    price * (1 - discountPercent / 100.0)
```

### 3. **String Manipulation for Metadata**

```aiken
-- Function to generate a formatted metadata string for an NFT
generateMetadataString : NFT -> String
generateMetadataString nft =
    String.concat [
        "NFT ID: ", String.fromInt(nft.id),
        ", Owner: ", PubKeyHash.toString(nft.owner),
        ", Metadata: ", nft.metadata
    ]
```

### 4. **Transaction Validation Functions**

```aiken
-- Function to validate if the payment matches the expected amount
validatePayment : Value -> Value -> Bool
validatePayment actual expected =
    actual == expected

-- Function to validate a user's signature on the transaction
validateSignature : PubKeyHash -> Signature -> Bool
validateSignature expectedPubKeyHash signature =
    verifySignature(signature, expectedPubKeyHash)  -- Using verifySignature from the library
```

### 5. **Event Logging Example**

```aiken
-- Function to log an event when a new NFT is created
logNFTCreation : NFT -> ()
logNFTCreation nft =
    log("New NFT Created: " ++ generateMetadataString(nft))  -- Using log function from the library
```

## Conclusion

The **Rich Standard Library** in Aiken-lang significantly enhances the efficiency and reliability of smart contract development on the Cardano blockchain. By utilizing pre-built functions and utilities, developers can focus on building advanced features like an NFT marketplace, DEX swaps, and more, without the overhead of implementing common functionalities from scratch.
