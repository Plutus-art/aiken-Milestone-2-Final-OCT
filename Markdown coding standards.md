# NFT Marketplace Coding Standards

## 1. Maintainability
- Use clear naming conventions
- Separate concerns into modular contracts
- Document code with concise comments

```solidity
// Example of maintainable code
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract NFTMarketplace {
    ...
}
```

## 2. Scalability
- Use mappings for large datasets
- Optimize gas usage by minimizing loops and unnecessary operations

```solidity
// Example of scalable code
mapping(uint256 => address) private nftOwners;
...
```

## 3. Security
- Implement reentrancy guards
- Validate user inputs
- Apply role-based access control

```solidity
// Example of secure code with ReentrancyGuard
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
contract NFTMarketplace is ReentrancyGuard {
    ...
}
```

## 4. Version Control
- Always specify the Solidity version
- Use semantic versioning for external dependencies

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```
```

By following these coding standards, the NFT marketplace code will be more maintainable, scalable, and secure. Each section ensures that development adheres to best practices and industry standards, making it easier for future contributors to understand and modify the project.
