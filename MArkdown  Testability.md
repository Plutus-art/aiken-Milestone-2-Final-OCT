# Testability in Aiken-lang Smart Contracts

Testing is a crucial part of smart contract development, ensuring that contracts behave as expected under different scenarios. Aiken-lang offers several features that facilitate the creation of comprehensive unit tests for marketplace smart contracts. This document will cover key testing strategies, code snippets for unit tests, and best practices to ensure robust functionality.

---

## 1. Overview of Aiken-lang Testability Features

Aiken-lang provides native support for unit testing, making it easy to validate the behavior of smart contracts through automated tests. Key features include:

- **Modular Test Functions**: Ability to define test functions that can be executed independently.
- **Mocking and Stubbing**: Support for simulating different contract states and external interactions (e.g., mock oracles).
- **Assertion Tools**: Built-in assertions for verifying expected outputs.
- **Test Isolation**: Ensuring that each test runs in a clean environment without side effects.

## 2. Writing Unit Tests in Aiken-lang

To illustrate how to test marketplace smart contracts in Aiken-lang, let’s create a unit test for a contract that handles token transfers within the marketplace. 

### Example: Basic Token Transfer Test

```aiken
// Marketplace smart contract for token transfers
type Token {
    id: TokenId
    owner: Address
    balance: int
}

// Function to transfer tokens between two addresses
fn transfer_tokens(sender: Address, recipient: Address, tokenId: TokenId, amount: int, tokens: Map<TokenId, Token>) -> Result<Map<TokenId, Token>, string> {
    match Map.get(tokens, tokenId) {
        Some(token) -> {
            if token.owner == sender && token.balance >= amount {
                let updatedToken = { token with balance: token.balance - amount }
                let updatedTokens = Map.insert(tokenId, updatedToken, tokens)
                Ok(updatedTokens)
            } else {
                Err("Insufficient balance or invalid owner")
            }
        }
        None -> Err("Token not found")
    }
}
```

### Unit Test for Token Transfer

```aiken
// Unit test for the token transfer function
fn test_token_transfer() -> bool {
    let sender = "addr1..."
    let recipient = "addr2..."
    let tokenId = TokenId("token1")
    let initialToken = Token { id: tokenId, owner: sender, balance: 100 }
    
    // Create initial token state
    let tokens = Map.insert(tokenId, initialToken, Map.empty)
    
    // Perform the transfer
    match transfer_tokens(sender, recipient, tokenId, 50, tokens) {
        Ok(updatedTokens) -> {
            let token = Map.get(updatedTokens, tokenId)
            match token {
                Some(t) -> t.balance == 50
                None -> false
            }
        }
        Err(_) -> false
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Test Scenario**: The test simulates a scenario where a token transfer of 50 units is attempted. It checks if the resulting balance is correctly updated.
- **Assertions**: The test validates that after the transfer, the token’s balance has been reduced to the correct amount.

### Running the Test

You can execute the test using Aiken’s built-in test framework:

```bash
aiken test
```

## 3. Advanced Testing with Mocking

In many cases, smart contracts interact with external systems (e.g., oracles). Aiken-lang allows developers to mock these interactions in unit tests to ensure that the smart contract logic behaves correctly under different external conditions.

### Example: Mocking Oracle Interaction

```aiken
// Mock function to simulate oracle response in tests
fn mock_oracle_response(requestId: ByteArray) -> int {
    // Simulate returning a fixed price from the oracle
    1500
}

// Function using oracle data to calculate the price in marketplace
fn get_price_from_oracle(tokenId: TokenId) -> Result<int, string> {
    let requestId = generate_request_id()
    let price = mock_oracle_response(requestId)
    if price > 0 {
        Ok(price)
    } else {
        Err("Oracle returned invalid price")
    }
}

// Test for oracle integration
fn test_oracle_integration() -> bool {
    match get_price_from_oracle(TokenId("token1")) {
        Ok(price) -> price == 1500
        Err(_) -> false
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Mocking Oracle Responses**: The `mock_oracle_response` function simulates the oracle’s behavior in a controlled environment, ensuring that you can test the smart contract logic without relying on external oracle services.
- **Test Validation**: The unit test verifies that the contract correctly handles and uses the mocked oracle data.

---

## 4. Testing Error Cases and Edge Conditions

It is important to test how smart contracts handle error conditions and edge cases, such as insufficient balances, unauthorized actions, or invalid data inputs.

### Example: Testing Insufficient Balance Error

```aiken
// Unit test for insufficient balance during token transfer
fn test_insufficient_balance() -> bool {
    let sender = "addr1..."
    let recipient = "addr2..."
    let tokenId = TokenId("token2")
    let initialToken = Token { id: tokenId, owner: sender, balance: 20 }  // Low balance
    
    let tokens = Map.insert(tokenId, initialToken, Map.empty)
    
    // Attempt to transfer more than available balance
    match transfer_tokens(sender, recipient, tokenId, 50, tokens) {
        Ok(_) -> false  // Should not succeed
        Err(error) -> error == "Insufficient balance or invalid owner"
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Test Scenario**: The test simulates a situation where the sender does not have enough tokens to complete the transfer, expecting the contract to return an error.
- **Assertions**: The test verifies that the correct error message is returned.

---

## 5. Isolating Tests and Ensuring Test Independence

Each test should run independently of others to avoid side effects that could compromise the integrity of the test suite. Aiken-lang’s testing framework ensures isolation by resetting contract state between test runs.

### Best Practice: Avoid Shared State

Avoid sharing mutable state between tests, as this can lead to unpredictable outcomes. Use fresh instances of contract data (e.g., token balances, oracle responses) in each test.

---

## 6. Test Coverage

To ensure comprehensive test coverage, it’s important to write tests for a wide range of scenarios, including:

- **Happy Paths**: Test that the contract behaves correctly under normal conditions (e.g., valid token transfers).
- **Error Conditions**: Ensure the contract properly handles errors, such as insufficient balance or invalid addresses.
- **Edge Cases**: Test unusual conditions, like transferring zero tokens or interacting with an empty contract state.
- **External Interactions**: Test how the contract handles external services, like oracles, under both success and failure scenarios.

---

## 7. Continuous Integration (CI) Setup for Aiken-lang Tests

To automate testing and ensure that all changes to the smart contract are verified before deployment, integrate Aiken-lang tests into a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.

### Example: GitHub Actions CI Configuration

```yaml
name: Aiken-lang Smart Contract Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install Aiken
        run: |
          curl -L https://github.com/aiken-lang/aiken/releases/download/v0.2.0/aiken-v0.2.0-linux-x64.tar.gz | tar -xz
          sudo mv aiken /usr/local/bin/
      - name: Run Aiken Tests
        run: aiken test
```

### Explanation:

- **CI Integration**: This example shows how to set up GitHub Actions to run Aiken-lang tests automatically on every push or pull request to the main branch.
- **Automated Testing**: This ensures that any new changes to the smart contract are tested automatically, preventing bugs from being introduced into production.
