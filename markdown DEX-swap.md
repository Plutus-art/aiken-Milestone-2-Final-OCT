# Swap DEX Smart Contract - Aiken-lang

## Overview

This project presents a robust decentralized exchange (DEX) implemented using **Aiken-lang**. The smart contract is specifically designed to facilitate token swaps, manage liquidity pools, and offer core decentralized finance (DeFi) features, with an emphasis on security and scalability. Below is a set of developed and newly developing features, along with the test results, and an explanation of new functions being implemented.

---

## Features

### 1. **Token Swap Functionality**
   The `swap_tokens` function enables users to exchange one type of token for another from the liquidity pool.

   **Function:**
   ```rust
   pub fn swap_tokens(
       token_in: Token,
       amount_in: U64,
       token_out: Token,
       pool: &mut LiquidityPool,
   ) -> Result<U64, String> {
       let amount_out = pool.calculate_amount_out(token_in, amount_in, token_out)?;
       pool.update_pool(token_in, amount_in, token_out, amount_out)?;
       Ok(amount_out)
   }
   ```

   **Description:**
   - Accepts two tokens (token_in and token_out) and the amount being swapped.
   - Uses the liquidity pool to calculate the amount of the second token the user will receive.
   - Updates the pool state after the swap.
   - Returns an error if the swap cannot be completed due to insufficient liquidity.

### 2. **Liquidity Pool Management**
   This feature allows users to add or remove liquidity from a pool, which is fundamental to maintaining the swap operation.

   **Function:**
   ```rust
   pub fn add_liquidity(
       pool: &mut LiquidityPool,
       token_a: Token,
       token_b: Token,
       amount_a: U64,
       amount_b: U64,
   ) -> Result<(), String> {
       pool.update_liquidity(token_a, amount_a, token_b, amount_b)?;
       Ok(())
   }
   ```

   **Description:**
   - Adds liquidity to the pool by updating token reserves.
   - Adjusts the pool’s liquidity ratios.
   - Returns an error if the update fails.

   **Remove Liquidity:**
   ```rust
   pub fn remove_liquidity(
       pool: &mut LiquidityPool,
       token_a: Token,
       token_b: Token,
       shares: U64,
   ) -> Result<(U64, U64), String> {
       let (amount_a, amount_b) = pool.calculate_withdrawal_amount(shares)?;
       pool.decrease_liquidity(token_a, token_b, amount_a, amount_b)?;
       Ok((amount_a, amount_b))
   }
   ```

   **Description:**
   - Removes liquidity by decreasing the pool reserves.
   - Calculates the amount of each token to be returned based on the user’s pool shares.

### 3. **Pricing Algorithm:**
   The contract uses a constant product formula (x * y = k) to calculate prices for token swaps.

   **Function:**
   ```rust
   pub fn calculate_amount_out(
       token_in: Token,
       amount_in: U64,
       token_out: Token,
       pool: &LiquidityPool,
   ) -> Result<U64, String> {
       // Constant product formula logic
       let amount_out = pool.get_output_amount(token_in, amount_in, token_out)?;
       Ok(amount_out)
   }
   ```

   **Description:**
   - Applies the constant product formula to calculate the amount of output tokens.
   - Returns the correct exchange amount or an error in case of insufficient liquidity.

### 4. **Fee Mechanism:**
   Swap transactions include a fee mechanism to incentivize liquidity providers and ensure platform sustainability.

   **Function:**
   ```rust
   pub fn apply_fee(amount: U64) -> U64 {
       let fee = (amount * 3) / 1000; // 0.3% fee
       amount - fee
   }
   ```

   **Description:**
   - A 0.3% fee is deducted from every swap transaction.
   - The fee is distributed to liquidity providers.

## New Features & Functions in Development

1. **Advanced Yield Farming & Staking:**
   - Yield farming mechanisms to reward users who stake liquidity tokens.
   - Additional staking rewards for long-term participants.

2. **Flash Loans:**
   - Implementation of flash loans for arbitrage opportunities.
   - Ensures repayment in the same transaction or reverts.

3. **Dynamic Fee Model:**
   - Dynamic fee adjustment based on market volatility or transaction size to improve platform efficiency.

4. **Cross-chain Swaps:**
   - Allowing token swaps between different blockchains by implementing cross-chain bridges.

---

## Test Results

The smart contract was tested across different scenarios to ensure it functions correctly.

### 1. **Unit Testing:**
   Each core function (swap, liquidity management, and fee application) has been unit tested for expected behavior.

   - **Swap Tokens:**
     - Passed with valid inputs (adequate liquidity).
     - Correctly reverted for invalid inputs (insufficient liquidity).

   - **Add/Remove Liquidity:**
     - Passed for valid liquidity additions and withdrawals.
     - Correctly handles errors such as trying to withdraw more liquidity than available.

### 2. **Integration Testing:**
   Full interaction testing between token swapping and liquidity management:

   - Swapping updates liquidity pools correctly.
   - Removing liquidity does not affect ongoing swaps.
   - Fees are applied and distributed correctly.

### 3. **Stress Testing:**
   The contract was stress tested under high transaction loads to verify its scalability.

   - Handled a large number of transactions without performance issues.
   - Dynamic pricing worked correctly under fluctuating liquidity conditions.

### Test Summary:

   - **Swap Function:** Successfully executed token swaps with accurate output token amounts.
   - **Liquidity Management:** Additions and removals from the liquidity pool functioned smoothly.
   - **Fee Application:** Transaction fees were deducted and calculated as expected.
