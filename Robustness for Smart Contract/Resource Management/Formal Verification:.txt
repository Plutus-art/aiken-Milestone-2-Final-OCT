### Define Contract Specifications with Formal Verification Features


The first step is to define the **formal specification** of your contract, which describes how the contract should behave in all possible situations.

-- Example: Formal specification for an NFT transfer function
-- Preconditions:
-- 1. The sender must own the NFT.
-- 2. The transaction must include a valid signature.
-- 3. The new owner must be a valid public key.

-- Postconditions:
-- 1. Ownership of the NFT is transferred to the new owner.
-- 2. The sender no longer holds the NFT.
