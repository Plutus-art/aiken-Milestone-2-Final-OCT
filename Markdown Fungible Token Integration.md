# Aiken-lang Smart Contract Integration: Fungible Tokens and NFTs

This document provides a detailed guide on how to integrate **fungible tokens** (e.g., Cardano native tokens) and **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)** in an Aiken-lang smart contract for a marketplace. Aiken-lang provides efficient mechanisms to work with Cardano’s native tokens as payment methods and to create/manage NFTs for unique digital assets.

## 1. Fungible Token Integration

Aiken-lang seamlessly integrates with Cardano's **native tokens**, making it possible to use fungible tokens as a form of payment within the marketplace. This is essential for enabling decentralized commerce and facilitating transactions in Cardano's ecosystem.

### Example: Accepting Fungible Tokens as Payment

In this example, we'll demonstrate how to receive payments in a specific fungible token (e.g., a token named "Plooty (PT)") within a smart contract for buying or selling items.

```aiken
// Data structure to define a marketplace item
type Item {
    itemId: int
    price: int
    seller: Address
    buyer: Option<Address>
}

// Example marketplace state holding items for sale
type MarketplaceState {
    items: Map<int, Item>
}

// Function to handle token payment for an item
fn buy_item(marketplace: MarketplaceState, itemId: int, buyer: Address, payment: TokenPayment) -> Result<MarketplaceState, string> {
    // Find the item in the marketplace
    match marketplace.items[itemId] {
        Some(item) -> {
            // Check if the payment is in the correct token and matches the item's price
            if payment.tokenId == "plo1utytokenid" && payment.amount >= item.price {
                // Update the item to reflect the buyer and complete the transaction
                let updatedItem = item { buyer = Some(buyer) }
                let updatedItems = Map.insert(marketplace.items, itemId, updatedItem)
                
                // Update the marketplace state
                let updatedMarketplace = marketplace { items = updatedItems }
                
                Ok(updatedMarketplace)
            } else {
                Err("Incorrect payment token or insufficient payment")
            }
        }
        None -> Err("Item not found")
    }
}

// Type to represent a fungible token payment
type TokenPayment {
    tokenId: string
    amount: int
}

// Example usage of the buy_item function
let payment = TokenPayment { tokenId = "plo1utytokenid", amount = 100 }
let buyerAddress = get_address_from_tx()

match buy_item(marketplace, 1, buyerAddress, payment) {
    Ok(updatedMarketplace) -> {
        log("Item purchased successfully")
    }
    Err(err) -> {
        log("Purchase failed: ", err)
    }
}
```

### Issues and Solutions

**Problem:** How to handle overpayment or token mismanagement?

**Solution:** Implement a refund mechanism if the buyer sends more than the required amount, or return a failure if incorrect tokens are used.

```aiken
// Refund overpayment logic
fn refund_overpayment(payment: TokenPayment, price: int) -> void {
    if payment.amount > price {
        let refundAmount = payment.amount - price
        // Logic to refund the excess tokens back to the buyer
        log("Refunding excess: ", refundAmount)
    }
}
```

## 2. NFT Integration

Aiken-lang supports the creation, management, and transfer of **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)** within the marketplace. NFTs represent unique digital assets, which can be integrated for use cases such as art, collectibles, or in-game items.

### Example: Minting an NFT in Aiken-lang

This example demonstrates how to mint a new NFT and add it to the marketplace, associating the NFT with a unique identifier and ownership information.

```aiken
// Data structure for an NFT
type NFT {
    nftId: string
    metadata: Map<string, string> // Metadata can hold properties like name, description, etc.
    owner: Address
}

// Function to mint a new NFT
fn mint_nft(owner: Address, metadata: Map<string, string>) -> NFT {
    let nftId = generate_nft_id() // Generate a unique NFT ID
    NFT { nftId, metadata, owner }
}

// Function to add the newly minted NFT to the marketplace
fn add_nft_to_marketplace(marketplace: MarketplaceState, nft: NFT, price: int) -> Result<MarketplaceState, string> {
    let newItem = Item { itemId = generate_item_id(), price, seller = nft.owner, buyer = None }
    let updatedItems = Map.insert(marketplace.items, newItem.itemId, newItem)
    
    let updatedMarketplace = marketplace { items = updatedItems }
    Ok(updatedMarketplace)
}

// Example usage of the minting and adding function
let ownerAddress = get_address_from_tx()
let nftMetadata = Map.fromList([("name", "Rare Art"), ("creator", "Artist Name")])
let newNFT = mint_nft(ownerAddress, nftMetadata)

match add_nft_to_marketplace(marketplace, newNFT, 500) {
    Ok(updatedMarketplace) -> log("NFT added to marketplace")
    Err(err) -> log("Error adding NFT: ", err)
}
```

### Example: Transferring Ownership of an NFT

Once an NFT is created, it can be listed in the marketplace and transferred from the seller to the buyer.

```aiken
// Function to transfer NFT ownership after a purchase
fn transfer_nft_ownership(marketplace: MarketplaceState, itemId: int, buyer: Address) -> Result<MarketplaceState, string> {
    // Find the item in the marketplace
    match marketplace.items[itemId] {
        Some(item) -> {
            // Ensure the item is an NFT and update the owner
            if item.buyer == Some(buyer) {
                // Transfer NFT ownership to the buyer
                let nft = get_nft_by_item(item) // Assume we can retrieve the NFT from the item
                let updatedNFT = nft { owner = buyer }
                
                // Update marketplace state to reflect new owner
                let updatedItems = Map.insert(marketplace.items, itemId, item { buyer = Some(buyer) })
                let updatedMarketplace = marketplace { items = updatedItems }
                
                Ok(updatedMarketplace)
            } else {
                Err("Buyer mismatch or item not found")
            }
        }
        None -> Err("Item not found")
    }
}
```

### Issues and Solutions

**Problem:** Ensuring that only valid NFTs are transferred, preventing double ownership.

**Solution:** Enforce validation checks on NFT ownership before transferring or selling, ensuring that no duplicate transfers occur.

```aiken
// Function to validate NFT ownership before transfer
fn validate_nft_ownership(nft: NFT, currentOwner: Address) -> Result<void, string> {
    if nft.owner == currentOwner {
        Ok(())
    } else {
        Err("Invalid ownership: Transfer not allowed")
    }
}
```

## 3. Marketplace with Fungible Tokens and NFTs

Integrating both **fungible tokens** and **NFTs** into the marketplace allows for versatile use cases, such as selling unique digital assets (NFTs) for fungible tokens or other currencies. Below is an example of how the marketplace can handle both types of assets.

### Example: Hybrid Marketplace (Fungible Tokens and NFTs)

```aiken
// Function to handle either fungible token or NFT purchase
fn purchase_item(marketplace: MarketplaceState, itemId: int, buyer: Address, payment: TokenPayment) -> Result<MarketplaceState, string> {
    match marketplace.items[itemId] {
        Some(item) -> {
            // If the item is an NFT
            if is_nft_item(item) {
                match validate_payment(payment, item.price) {
                    Ok(()) -> transfer_nft_ownership(marketplace, itemId, buyer)
                    Err(err) -> Err(err)
                }
            } else {
                // Handle fungible token payment
                match validate_payment(payment, item.price) {
                    Ok(()) -> {
                        let updatedMarketplace = process_fungible_token_payment(marketplace, itemId, buyer, payment)
                        Ok(updatedMarketplace)
                    }
                    Err(err) -> Err(err)
                }
            }
        }
        None -> Err("Item not found")
    }
}

// Helper function to check if the item is an NFT
fn is_nft_item(item: Item) -> bool {
    // Check if the item corresponds to an NFT (could be based on item metadata)
    true
}

// Function to process fungible token payment
fn process_fungible_token_payment(marketplace: MarketplaceState, itemId: int, buyer: Address, payment: TokenPayment) -> MarketplaceState {
    // Logic to transfer fungible tokens and update marketplace state
    let updatedItems = Map.insert(marketplace.items, itemId, item { buyer = Some(buyer) })
    marketplace { items = updatedItems }
}
```
