# Testing Framework in Aiken-lang

Testing is an essential part of smart contract development, and Aiken-lang offers a robust testing framework that ensures your contracts are correct, secure, and bug-free. This guide provides an overview of the Aiken-lang testing framework, explains how to write tests, and demonstrates how to execute them.

## Why Testing Matters

Smart contracts are immutable once deployed, meaning any bugs or vulnerabilities cannot be fixed after deployment. Thorough testing during development ensures:

- **Correctness**: Contracts behave as expected.
- **Security**: There are no vulnerabilities or unexpected behaviors.
- **Reliability**: Contracts handle all edge cases and potential errors.
  
The Aiken-lang testing framework allows developers to write unit tests, simulate contract interactions, and validate expected outcomes before deployment.

## Writing Tests in Aiken-lang

Tests in Aiken-lang are written in the same syntax as regular code and reside within dedicated test modules. The framework supports unit testing, property-based testing, and other testing methodologies.

### Basic Unit Test Example

A simple unit test in Aiken-lang might look like this:

```aiken
-- File: tests/math_tests.aiken

module tests.math_tests

import aiken/testing

fn test_addition() -> Bool {
    result = 2 + 3
    testing.assert_equal(result, 5, "2 + 3 should equal 5")
}
```

Here’s what’s happening:
- **Module Declaration**: The test file is part of the `tests` module.
- **Test Function**: The `test_addition` function checks if `2 + 3` equals `5`.
- **Assertion**: The `testing.assert_equal` function compares the result to the expected value and includes an error message if the test fails.

### Running the Test

You can run this test using the Aiken test command:

```bash
aiken test
```

If the test passes, the framework will confirm the success. If the test fails, the framework will output an error message and a stack trace to help you debug the issue.

## Using the Testing Module

Aiken-lang provides a comprehensive `testing` module that includes multiple assert functions for different use cases:

### Common Assert Functions

- **`testing.assert_equal(actual, expected, msg)`**  
  Asserts that the `actual` value matches the `expected` value.

  ```aiken
  testing.assert_equal(2 + 2, 4, "Math works!")
  ```

- **`testing.assert_not_equal(actual, expected, msg)`**  
  Asserts that the `actual` value does not match the `expected` value.

  ```aiken
  testing.assert_not_equal(2 + 2, 5, "Math doesn't lie!")
  ```

- **`testing.assert_true(condition, msg)`**  
  Asserts that the `condition` evaluates to `true`.

  ```aiken
  testing.assert_true(1 < 2, "1 is indeed less than 2")
  ```

- **`testing.assert_false(condition, msg)`**  
  Asserts that the `condition` evaluates to `false`.

  ```aiken
  testing.assert_false(1 > 2, "1 is not greater than 2")
  ```

### Testing Smart Contracts

You can also write tests for your smart contracts to ensure that they behave correctly under different scenarios. Here's an example of testing a token transfer function:

```aiken
-- File: tests/token_contract_tests.aiken

module tests.token_contract_tests

import aiken/testing
import my_contracts/token

fn test_token_transfer() -> Bool {
    initial_balance = 1000
    amount_to_transfer = 100
    new_balance = token.transfer(initial_balance, amount_to_transfer)

    testing.assert_equal(new_balance, 900, "Balance should decrease after transfer")
}
```

In this example:
- **`token.transfer`** is the function from your smart contract that performs a token transfer.
- The test checks that the new balance is correctly reduced by the transfer amount.

### Testing for Errors

You can also test for cases where the contract should return an error, ensuring that your contract handles invalid inputs properly:

```aiken
fn test_invalid_transfer() -> Bool {
    initial_balance = 100
    amount_to_transfer = 200

    error = testing.catch_error(token.transfer(initial_balance, amount_to_transfer))
    
    testing.assert_equal(error, "Insufficient funds", "Should return error for insufficient funds")
}
```

Here, `testing.catch_error` is used to capture the error returned by the `token.transfer` function when trying to transfer more than the available balance.

## Organizing Tests

To keep your project organized, it’s best practice to place all tests in a `tests` directory. Aiken-lang will automatically detect tests in this directory when running `aiken test`.

```
project-root/
│
├── src/
│   └── contracts/
│       └── token.aiken
│
├── tests/
│   └── math_tests.aiken
│   └── token_contract_tests.aiken
```

### Test Annotations

In Aiken-lang, you can use annotations to specify test cases. The annotation `#[test]` identifies which functions are tests, so you can include both regular functions and test functions in the same module.

```aiken
module tests.example_tests

import aiken/testing

#[test]
fn test_example() -> Bool {
    testing.assert_equal(1 + 1, 2, "Simple addition works")
}
```

## Running All Tests

To run all tests in your project, simply use the following command:

```bash
aiken test
```

This will execute all the test files under the `tests` directory and provide detailed output on any failures or errors encountered.

## Example: Property-Based Testing

Property-based testing checks that a certain property holds for a wide range of inputs. Aiken-lang supports property-based testing, allowing you to ensure that your contracts behave correctly over a broad set of scenarios.

```aiken
fn property_test_addition() -> Bool {
    testing.for_all(Int, Int, (a, b) -> Bool {
        result = a + b
        expected = b + a
        testing.assert_equal(result, expected, "Addition should be commutative")
    })
}
```

In this example, the test checks if addition is commutative (`a + b == b + a`) for any pair of integers.

## Conclusion

The Aiken-lang testing framework is an invaluable tool for smart contract developers. It allows you to catch errors early, ensures that your contracts behave as expected, and provides a smooth development experience. By writing thorough tests, you can confidently deploy secure and reliable smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain.

### Key Takeaways

- Write unit tests using the `testing` module.
- Use assert functions like `assert_equal` and `assert_true` to validate expected outcomes.
- Test smart contract functions under different scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions.
- Organize your tests in the `tests` directory for easy management.

Make sure to leverage the power of the Aiken-lang testing framework to ensure your Cardano smart contracts are safe and bug-free!
