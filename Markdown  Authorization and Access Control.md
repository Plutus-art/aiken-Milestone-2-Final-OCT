# Authorization and Access Control in Aiken-Lang Smart Contracts

In any decentralized marketplace, it is crucial to have a robust **Authorization and Access Control** mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can access specific functionalities based on their roles (e.g., admin, buyer, seller). Aiken-lang offers several ways to implement role-based access control.

This document provides an overview of old and new functions used for authorization and access control in Aiken-lang smart contracts, including code snippets for comparison.

## 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - Old Functions

In earlier versions of Aiken-lang, access control was primarily managed by hardcoding logic into functions, checking if the user had the required role for certain operations. This method was simple but often lacked flexibility and could result in bloated code.

### Old Approach Example: Checking Roles Directly in Functions

```aiken
// Define roles as basic string types
let adminRole = "admin"
let buyerRole = "buyer"
let sellerRole = "seller"

// Old function: Manually checking role in each function
fn update_price(seller: Address, user: Address, price: int) -> Result<void, string> {
    if seller == user && get_role(user) == sellerRole {
        // Update the price if the user is a seller
        update_listing_price(price)
        Ok(())
    } else {
        Err("Unauthorized: Only sellers can update the price")
    }
}

// Function to get the role (hardcoded for simplicity in this example)
fn get_role(user: Address) -> string {
    if user == adminAddress {
        adminRole
    } else if user == sellerAddress {
        sellerRole
    } else {
        buyerRole
    }
}
```

### Issues with the Old Approach

- **Repetitive Code**: Role-checking logic is repeated across multiple functions.
- **Hardcoded Roles**: Roles and permissions are hardcoded, making it difficult to manage or extend.
- **Error-Prone**: Adding or modifying roles requires changes across multiple functions, increasing the risk of bugs or security issues.

## 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - New Functions

The new approach introduces more modular and reusable role-checking functions, making it easier to handle user permissions and roles dynamically. This provides greater flexibility and allows for better security and code maintainability.

### New Approach Example: Modular Role Checks and Permissions

In the new approach, we centralize role checks and permissions into reusable functions, improving scalability and reducing redundancy.

#### Step 1: Define Role Types

```aiken
// Define roles using an Enum for better type safety and readability
type Role {
    Admin
    Buyer
    Seller
}

// Mapping of users to roles (stored off-chain or in metadata)
let userRoles: Map<Address, Role> = Map.empty()

// Function to assign a role to a user (example for admin use only)
fn assign_role(user: Address, role: Role) -> void {
    userRoles = Map.insert(user, role, userRoles)
}
```

#### Step 2: Centralized Role Validation

```aiken
// New function: Centralized role validation
fn authorize(user: Address, requiredRole: Role) -> Result<void, string> {
    match Map.lookup(user, userRoles) {
        Some(role) -> 
            if role == requiredRole {
                Ok(())
            } else {
                Err("Unauthorized: Insufficient permissions")
            }
        None -> Err("Unauthorized: No role assigned")
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Updated Marketplace Functions with Access Control

```aiken
// New function: Role-based price update for sellers
fn update_price(user: Address, price: int) -> Result<void, string> {
    match authorize(user, Seller) {
        Ok(()) -> {
            // Update price logic here
            update_listing_price(price)
            Ok(())
        }
        Err(err) -> Err(err)
    }
}

// New function: Admin-only feature for removing listings
fn remove_listing(user: Address, listingId: string) -> Result<void, string> {
    match authorize(user, Admin) {
        Ok(()) -> {
            // Remove the listing
            delete_listing(listingId)
            Ok(())
        }
        Err(err) -> Err(err)
    }
}

// New function: Buyer access to purchasing
fn purchase_item(user: Address, itemId: string) -> Result<void, string> {
    match authorize(user, Buyer) {
        Ok(()) -> {
            // Process the purchase
            buy_item(itemId)
            Ok(())
        }
        Err(err) -> Err(err)
    }
}
```

## 3. Handling Multiple Roles and Hierarchies

In a marketplace, users may need to hold multiple roles (e.g., a user could be both a seller and a buyer). The new approach supports role hierarchies and multiple roles with more flexibility.

### Example: Supporting Multiple Roles

```aiken
// Function to check if a user has any of the given roles
fn authorize_multi_role(user: Address, allowedRoles: List<Role>) -> Result<void, string> {
    match Map.lookup(user, userRoles) {
        Some(role) -> 
            if List.member(role, allowedRoles) {
                Ok(())
            } else {
                Err("Unauthorized: Insufficient permissions")
            }
        None -> Err("Unauthorized: No role assigned")
    }
}

// Example function: Allow both Admins and Sellers to update listings
fn update_listing(user: Address, listingId: string, newPrice: int) -> Result<void, string> {
    match authorize_multi_role(user, [Admin, Seller]) {
        Ok(()) -> {
            // Update listing logic here
            update_listing_price(listingId, newPrice)
            Ok(())
        }
        Err(err) -> Err(err)
    }
}
```

### Common Issue: Role Revocation

**Problem:** Users might retain roles even after they should lose access, leading to unauthorized actions.

**Solution:** Implement a role revocation mechanism to remove user roles dynamically.

```aiken
// Function to revoke a user's role
fn revoke_role(user: Address) -> void {
    userRoles = Map.remove(user, userRoles)
}
```

## Conclusion

The new approach to authorization and access control in Aiken-lang smart contracts offers several benefits over the older method:

- **Modular and Reusable Code**: Role-checking logic is centralized, improving code readability and maintainability.
- **Improved Flexibility**: The new approach supports multiple roles, dynamic role assignment, and hierarchies, making it easier to manage complex permissions.
- **Security Enhancements**: By centralizing and simplifying role validation, the risk of security issues is reduced.

This modular, scalable approach ensures that only authorized users can access specific marketplace functionalities, leading to a more secure and efficient marketplace.
