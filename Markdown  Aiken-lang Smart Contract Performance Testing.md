# Aiken-lang Smart Contract Performance Testing

This repository provides a guide and sample scripts for performance testing smart contracts written in Aiken-lang. The goal of the performance tests is to assess the impact of new features, such as NFT minting and DEX swaps, on the overall performance of the contracts.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. **Aiken-lang** installed on your machine.
2. **Cardano testnet wallet** and **test ADA** to deploy contracts.
3. Python or JavaScript environment with Cardano libraries like `cardano-serialization-lib` for off-chain scripts.

### Installing Aiken-lang

You can install Aiken-lang by following the [official installation guide](https://aiken-lang.org/docs/installation).

## Test Scenarios

In these performance tests, we will simulate different smart contract operations, including:

- **NFT Minting**
- **DEX Swaps**
- **Secondary Market Sales**

These scenarios help measure the efficiency of the smart contracts under varying conditions.

### Example: Test NFT Minting Performance

```aiken
xfunc mint_nft(nft_id: NFTID, owner: Address) -> Bool {
    -- Simulate minting logic
    let new_nft = create_nft(nft_id, owner);
    -- Return minting success
    new_nft != null
}
```

### Example: Test DEX Swap Performance

```aiken
xfunc dex_swap(token_in: Token, amount_in: Amount, token_out: Token) -> Bool {
    let swapped_amount = calculate_swap(token_in, amount_in, token_out);
    -- Simulate swap transaction success
    swapped_amount > 0
}
```

## Deployment

Once you have written your smart contracts, you can deploy them to the Cardano testnet.

```bash
aiken build
aiken testnet-deploy --network testnet --contract path/to/contract
```

### Verifying Deployment

Make sure to verify the deployment by checking the testnet explorer for successful contract registration.

## Performance Test Scripts

We can use off-chain scripts to automate performance testing of smart contracts. These scripts will simulate the real-world usage of your contracts under different conditions.

### Example: Simulating NFT Minting Workload (Python)

```python
import time
from cardano_serialization_lib import TransactionBuilder, Address, Value, TransactionOutput

def test_nft_minting(load_factor):
    for i in range(load_factor):
        tx_builder = TransactionBuilder()
        owner_address = Address.from_bech32('addr_test1...')
        nft_id = "nft_" + str(i)
        
        # Call smart contract to mint NFT
        tx_output = TransactionOutput(owner_address, Value(1))
        tx_builder.add_output(tx_output)
        
        # Submit transaction to the network (pseudo code)
        submit_transaction(tx_builder.build())
        time.sleep(1)  # Delay between transactions to simulate realistic load

test_nft_minting(100)  # Simulate 100 NFT mints
```

### Example: Calculating Gas Usage

You can also measure gas usage for transactions, which helps determine the computational cost of each action.

```aiken
xfunc mint_nft(nft_id: NFTID, owner: Address) -> Bool {
    let gas_start = get_gas_used();       -- Capture starting gas
    let new_nft = create_nft(nft_id, owner);
    let gas_end = get_gas_used();         -- Capture ending gas
    log_gas_usage(gas_end - gas_start);   -- Log or return gas usage
    new_nft != null
}
```

## Metrics and Analysis

After running your performance tests, capture the following metrics:

- **Execution Time**: Measure how long each transaction takes.
- **Gas Usage**: Track the gas (or fees) used by each operation.
- **Success Rate**: How many transactions succeed vs. fail under load.

This information will help you evaluate the efficiency of your smart contract and identify areas for optimization.

## Automating Performance Testing

To automate testing under different conditions (e.g., varying transaction volumes or concurrent DEX swaps), create scripts that:

1. Run the smart contract operations in parallel.
2. Capture performance metrics for comparison across scenarios.

### Example: Automated NFT Minting Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..100}; do
    # Call Python script to simulate NFT minting
    python test_nft_minting.py
done
```

## Conclusion

This guide shows how to conduct performance tests for Aiken-lang smart contracts. By using real-world simulations and capturing performance metrics, you can measure the effectiveness of your new features and optimize your smart contracts for production use.

### Key Takeaways:

- **Test Scenarios**: Simulate high load conditions (minting, swaps, etc.).
- **Metrics**: Focus on gas usage and execution time to assess performance.
- **Automation**: Use scripts to run bulk transactions and collect data.
