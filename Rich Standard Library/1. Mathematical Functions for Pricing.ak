 # Rich Standard Library in Aiken-lang for Smart Contracts

Aiken-lang provides a **Rich Standard Library** that simplifies and enhances the development of smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. This library includes a wide range of pre-built functions and utilities, allowing developers to focus on building robust applications without reinventing the wheel.

## Features of the Rich Standard Library

1. **Data Structures**: 
   - Provides immutable data structures like lists, maps, and sets.
   - Built-in support for complex data types to represent NFTs, tokens, and user transactions.

2. **Mathematical Functions**:
   - Comprehensive set of mathematical functions for performing calculations, useful for pricing and rewards systems.

3. **String Manipulation**:
   - Functions for string handling, including concatenation, slicing, and formatting, essential for managing metadata.

4. **Validation Functions**:
   - Pre-defined functions to validate transactions, signatures, and contract states, ensuring compliance and security.

5. **Event Logging**:
   - Built-in logging functionalities for tracing contract events, which help in debugging and monitoring contract behavior.

## Code Snippets Using the Rich Standard Library

### 1. **Creating and Managing NFTs**

```aiken
-- Importing necessary modules from the Rich Standard Library
import List
import Map

-- Defining an NFT structure
type NFT = { id: Int, owner: PubKeyHash, metadata: String }

-- Function to create a new NFT
createNFT : PubKeyHash -> String -> NFT
createNFT owner metadata =
    let
        id = generateNFTId() -- Using a function from the library to generate a unique ID
    in
        { id = id, owner = owner, metadata = metadata }

-- Function to list NFTs owned by a specific user
listNFTsByOwner : PubKeyHash -> List NFT -> List NFT
listNFTsByOwner owner nfts =
    List.filter (\nft -> nft.owner == owner) nfts
