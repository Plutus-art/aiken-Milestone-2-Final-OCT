# # Feature Design: 
Aiken-lang's feature design centers around two key areas: developer experience and robustness for smart contracts. Here's a breakdown of some potential design choices based on this focus: https://github.com/Plutus-art/aiken-Milestone-2-Final-OCT/blob/main/Markdown%20Feature%20design.md

Developer Experience:
Type Safety: Aiken could enforce type annotations to prevent runtime errors and make code easier to understand and maintain.
Functional Programming Paradigm: This paradigm can simplify reasoning about program behavior and potentially reduce bugs.

# Markdown: https://github.com/Plutus-art/aiken-Milestone-2-Final-OCT/blob/main/Markdown%20Feature%20design.md
Developer Experience:
Type Safety: Aiken could enforce type annotations to prevent runtime errors and make code easier to understand and maintain.
Functional Programming Paradigm: This paradigm can simplify reasoning about program behavior and potentially reduce bugs.
Clear and Concise Syntax: Aiken might borrow from languages like Rust or Elm to have a clean and readable syntax that reduces boilerplate code.
Excellent Error Messages: Informative error messages can help developers pinpoint issues quickly and efficiently.
Rich Standard Library: A well-stocked library with pre-built functions and data structures can save developers time and effort.


### Robustness for Smart Contracts:
# Markdown: https://github.com/Plutus-art/aiken-Milestone-2-Final-OCT/blob/main/Markdown%20Robustness%20for%20Smart%20Contracts%3A.md
Immutability: Encouraging immutable data structures can prevent accidental modification of state and potential security vulnerabilities.
Formal Verification: Aiken might integrate with tools for formal verification, allowing developers to mathematically prove the correctness of their code.
Resource Management: The language could have built-in mechanisms for managing resources like memory and computation to prevent bugs and denial-of-service attacks.
Access Control: Features like fine-grained access control can help ensure only authorized users can interact with the smart contract.

###  Focus on Cardano:
## Markdown: https://github.com/Plutus-art/aiken-Milestone-2-Final-OCT/blob/main/cardano%20focus/aiken-lang%20cardano%20ecosystem.txt
Unlike general-purpose languages, Aiken is built with Cardano in mind. It provides a high-quality toolkit specifically for developing reliable smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain.

### Simplicity and Manageability:
##Markdown: https://github.com/Plutus-art/aiken-Milestone-2-Final-OCT/blob/main/Markdown%20Simplicity%20aiken-lang
Considering the critical nature of smart contracts, Aiken keeps the language itself small and focused. This allows for easier understanding and reduces the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.

### # Coding Standards: 
While Aiken-lang has a focus on developer experience, there isn't a formal document outlining a strict coding standard like some other languages. However, there are resources that can guide you in writing clean and secure Aiken code:

## Standard Library (stdlib): The Aiken standard library (https://github.com/aiken-lang/stdlib) serves as a good reference. It showcases well-written and well-tested Aiken code, providing examples of idiomatic usage.

--*Markdown: https://github.com/Plutus-art/aiken-Milestone-2-Final-OCT/blob/main/Markdown%20Standard%20Library%20(stdlib).md

## Community Resources: The Aiken project likely has a community around it. Searching for resources like community forums, discussions, or blog posts related to "Aiken coding practices" or "Aiken best practices" might reveal conventions or preferred coding styles within the community.
General Smart Contract Security: Since Aiken targets smart contracts, security best practices for smart contract development are generally applicable. Resources on secure smart contract coding in general can provide valuable guidance.
