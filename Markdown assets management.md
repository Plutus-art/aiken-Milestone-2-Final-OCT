# Asset Management in Aiken-Lang Smart Contracts

This document outlines the implementation of asset management within the marketplace, specifically for creating, listing, and managing different asset types such as **tokens** and **NFTs**. Aiken-lang provides a robust foundation for handling these asset types on the Cardano blockchain.

## 1. Asset Creation

Aiken-lang enables seamless creation of both fungible tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with proper metadata. Below is a guide on how to create these assets.

### Example: Creating Tokens

```aiken
// Define a function to mint a token
fn mint_token(policy: Policy, owner: Address, amount: int) -> Token {
    let token = Token {
        policy_id: policy.id,
        asset_name: "Plooty",
        quantity: amount
    }
    
    mint(owner, token)
}
```

### Example: Creating an NFT

```aiken
// Define an NFT minting function
fn mint_nft(policy: Policy, owner: Address, metadata: Metadata) -> NFT {
    let nft = NFT {
        policy_id: policy.id,
        asset_name: metadata.name,
        metadata: metadata
    }
    
    mint(owner, nft)
}

// Example metadata for NFT creation
let nftMetadata = Metadata {
    name: "Digital Art",
    creator: "Artist Name",
    description: "A unique piece of digital art"
}
```

### Common Issue: Policy ID Management

**Problem:** If you don’t handle the policy ID properly or update the policy after asset creation, the assets may not be recognizable or transferable.

**Solution:** Ensure that the policy is fixed for the asset class and is properly registered on-chain before minting.

```aiken
// Register the policy before minting
let policy = Policy {
    id: hash(policyScript),
    script: policyScript
}
```

## 2. Listing Assets in the Marketplace

Once assets (tokens or NFTs) are created, they can be listed in the marketplace for users to interact with. Listing involves registering the asset details on-chain so that it’s accessible for buying, selling, or trading.

### Example: Listing an Asset

```aiken
// Function to list an asset in the marketplace
fn list_asset(asset: Asset, price: int, seller: Address) -> Listing {
    let listing = Listing {
        asset: asset,
        price: price,
        seller: seller,
        status: "Available"
    }

    // Store the listing in the marketplace ledger
    save_listing(listing)
}
```

### Common Issue: Incorrect Pricing

**Problem:** If the price of an asset is set incorrectly (e.g., too low due to a calculation bug), it could be purchased for much less than its value.

**Solution:** Validate the price input and apply a price-checking mechanism before listing.

```aiken
// Validate price before listing
fn validate_price(price: int) -> Result<int, string> {
    if price <= 0 {
        Err("Invalid price: must be greater than zero")
    } else {
        Ok(price)
    }
}

let validatedPrice = validate_price(price) // Apply validation before listing
```

## 3. Managing Assets (Transfers and Ownership)

Managing assets includes transferring ownership, burning tokens, and updating listings in the marketplace. Proper handling ensures that users can securely and easily trade assets without encountering issues like ownership disputes or loss of funds.

### Example: Transferring Ownership of an Asset

```aiken
// Function to transfer asset ownership
fn transfer_ownership(asset: Asset, newOwner: Address) -> Asset {
    let updatedAsset = asset {
        owner = newOwner
    }

    // Save the updated asset
    update_asset(updatedAsset)

    updatedAsset
}
```

### Common Issue: Double-Spend Problem

**Problem:** If a user attempts to transfer an asset and simultaneously use it in another transaction, this could result in a double-spend issue, where the asset is incorrectly transferred twice.

**Solution:** Implement locking mechanisms to prevent assets from being transferred or used in multiple transactions concurrently.

```aiken
// Lock the asset during a transaction to prevent double-spend
fn lock_asset(asset: Asset) -> Asset {
    let lockedAsset = asset {
        is_locked = true
    }

    update_asset(lockedAsset)
}
```

## 4. Burning Tokens or NFTs

There may be scenarios where tokens or NFTs need to be permanently removed from circulation, which requires burning the asset.

### Example: Burning a Token or NFT

```aiken
// Function to burn an asset
fn burn_asset(asset: Asset) -> void {
    burn(asset)

    // Optionally, remove the asset from the marketplace
    remove_listing(asset)
}
```

### Common Issue: Unauthorized Burn Attempts

**Problem:** Unauthorized users might attempt to burn tokens or NFTs they do not own.

**Solution:** Implement strict ownership checks before allowing burn operations.

```aiken
// Ensure only the owner can burn the asset
fn authorize_burn(asset: Asset, user: Address) -> Result<void, string> {
    if asset.owner == user {
        Ok(())
    } else {
        Err("Unauthorized burn attempt")
    }
}
```

## 5. Listing Removal and Marketplace Cleanup

Listings may need to be removed when an asset is sold or when a listing expires. It's important to keep the marketplace data clean and up-to-date.

### Example: Removing a Listing

```aiken
// Function to remove a listing from the marketplace
fn remove_listing(asset: Asset) -> void {
    delete_listing(asset)
}
```

### Common Issue: Stale Listings

**Problem:** When an asset is transferred or burned, its listing may remain in the marketplace, leading to confusion and potential purchase attempts of a non-existent asset.

**Solution:** Ensure that any transfer or burn operations automatically trigger listing removal.

```aiken
// Remove the listing when an asset is transferred or burned
fn transfer_or_burn(asset: Asset, action: TransferOrBurn) -> void {
    match action {
        Transfer(newOwner) -> transfer_ownership(asset, newOwner)
        Burn() -> burn_asset(asset)
    }

    remove_listing(asset)
}
```

## Conclusion

Aiken-lang provides a comprehensive set of tools to manage different asset types like tokens and NFTs in a Cardano-based marketplace. By following best practices for asset creation, listing, transfer, and burning, you can ensure smooth operations while preventing common pitfalls like double-spends, incorrect pricing, and unauthorized transactions.

Remember to always test your smart contracts thoroughly to catch any edge cases and ensure security.
