# Oracle Integration in Aiken-lang Smart Contracts

In decentralized marketplaces, external data feeds (oracles) are essential for retrieving real-world data such as asset prices, weather information, or other external events that smart contracts cannot access natively. Aiken-lang provides mechanisms to securely integrate with oracle networks, ensuring that external data can be fetched and verified on-chain.

This document explores how to implement oracle integration in Aiken-lang smart contracts, along with code snippets that illustrate how to request, verify, and handle oracle responses in a secure manner.

## 1. Requesting Data from an Oracle

Smart contracts in Aiken-lang can send requests to oracle networks to retrieve specific data. This request is typically emitted as an event that off-chain services or oracle providers listen to, process, and respond back with the requested data.

### Example: Requesting Token Price from Oracle

```aiken
// Structure for an oracle data request
type OracleRequest {
    requestId: ByteArray
    dataType: string  // Data type could be "price", "weather", etc.
    parameters: List<string>
}

// Emit a request event for off-chain oracle to listen to
fn request_price_data(tokenId: TokenId) -> Result<void, string> {
    let requestId = generate_request_id()
    let request = OracleRequest { 
        requestId: requestId, 
        dataType: "price", 
        parameters: [tokenId_to_string(tokenId)] 
    }
    emit_event("OracleRequest", request)
    Ok(())
}

// Helper function to generate unique request IDs
fn generate_request_id() -> ByteArray {
    // Create a random unique identifier for the oracle request
    hash(timestamp_to_bytearray(get_current_timestamp()))
}

// Example usage in the marketplace
fn get_token_price(tokenId: TokenId) -> Result<void, string> {
    request_price_data(tokenId)
}
```

### Explanation:

- The `request_price_data` function constructs an `OracleRequest` containing the necessary parameters (e.g., tokenId) and emits it as an event for the oracle network to pick up.
- The unique `requestId` helps track and verify the response from the oracle.

---

## 2. Handling Oracle Responses

Once the oracle processes the request, it pushes the data back to the smart contract, where the contract verifies and uses the data.

### Example: Handling Oracle Response

```aiken
// Structure for oracle response
type OracleResponse {
    requestId: ByteArray
    data: int  // In this case, the price of the token
}

// Function to handle and verify oracle responses
fn handle_oracle_response(response: OracleResponse) -> Result<void, string> {
    // Verify the requestId and process the response
    if is_valid_request(response.requestId) {
        // Use the oracle-provided data (e.g., price)
        log("Oracle Response for requestId: ", response.requestId)
        log("Received price: ", response.data)
        
        // Proceed with marketplace logic using the price
        Ok(())
    } else {
        Err("Invalid Oracle Response")
    }
}

// Helper function to verify if the requestId is valid
fn is_valid_request(requestId: ByteArray) -> bool {
    // Implement logic to verify the requestId (e.g., match it with previously stored IDs)
    true
}
```

### Explanation:

- The `handle_oracle_response` function is called when the oracle network returns the data. The response includes the `requestId` for matching the response to the correct request and the actual data (e.g., price).
- The function verifies the validity of the response before using the data.

---

## 3. Aggregating Oracle Data for Security

For enhanced security, especially when dealing with critical data (such as prices), multiple oracles can be used to provide data. The smart contract can then aggregate these responses to minimize the risk of a single oracle returning incorrect data.

### Example: Aggregating Oracle Responses

```aiken
// Function to aggregate responses from multiple oracles
fn aggregate_oracle_responses(requestId: ByteArray, responses: List<int>) -> Result<int, string> {
    if List.length(responses) > 0 {
        // Calculate average price from multiple oracles
        let avgPrice = List.sum(responses) / List.length(responses)
        log("Aggregated price: ", avgPrice)
        Ok(avgPrice)
    } else {
        Err("No valid responses received")
    }
}

// Example usage: Collect and aggregate oracle responses
fn handle_multiple_responses(requestId: ByteArray, responses: List<int>) -> Result<void, string> {
    match aggregate_oracle_responses(requestId, responses) {
        Ok(avgPrice) -> {
            // Use the aggregated price in the marketplace logic
            Ok(())
        }
        Err(err) -> Err(err)
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- The `aggregate_oracle_responses` function takes a list of responses from different oracle sources and computes the average. This helps mitigate the risk of relying on a single oracle’s data.
- By aggregating data, the contract can ensure better accuracy and robustness in decision-making.

## 4. Securing Oracle Data

It is crucial to secure the oracle data to prevent malicious actors from tampering with the oracle responses. One approach is to use **signatures** from trusted oracle providers, allowing the smart contract to verify the authenticity of the data.

### Example: Verifying Oracle Signature

```aiken
// Structure for signed oracle response
type SignedOracleResponse {
    response: OracleResponse
    signature: ByteArray
}

// Public key of the trusted oracle provider (in practice, this would be set securely)
const ORACLE_PUBLIC_KEY: ByteArray = "0x123456..."

// Function to verify oracle response signature
fn verify_oracle_signature(signedResponse: SignedOracleResponse) -> Result<void, string> {
    if verify_signature(ORACLE_PUBLIC_KEY, signedResponse.signature, signedResponse.response) {
        log("Valid Oracle Response from trusted provider")
        handle_oracle_response(signedResponse.response)
        Ok(())
    } else {
        Err("Invalid Oracle Signature")
    }
}

// Helper function to verify the oracle's signature
fn verify_signature(publicKey: ByteArray, signature: ByteArray, response: OracleResponse) -> bool {
    // Implement signature verification logic
    true
}
```

### Explanation:

- The `verify_oracle_signature` function checks if the response is signed by a trusted oracle provider using the provider’s public key.
- The contract only processes the response if the signature verification succeeds, ensuring that the data is authentic and untampered.

## 5. Fallback Mechanism for Oracle Failures

To handle scenarios where the oracle network fails to respond, the smart contract can implement fallback mechanisms, such as using default values or triggering alternative oracle services.

### Example: Oracle Fallback Logic

```aiken
// Fallback mechanism in case of oracle failure
fn handle_oracle_failure(requestId: ByteArray) -> Result<int, string> {
    log("Oracle failed to respond. Using fallback value.")
    
    // Fallback value (e.g., last known price or a default value)
    let fallbackPrice = 1000  // Placeholder for a sensible default
    Ok(fallbackPrice)
}

// Main function to either use oracle data or fallback
fn get_price_with_fallback(tokenId: TokenId, responses: List<int>) -> Result<int, string> {
    if List.length(responses) > 0 {
        aggregate_oracle_responses(generate_request_id(), responses)
    } else {
        handle_oracle_failure(generate_request_id())
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- The `handle_oracle_failure` function provides a fallback value if the oracle fails to respond, allowing the marketplace to continue operating without interruption.
- The `get_price_with_fallback` function ensures that either valid oracle data or a fallback value is used.
