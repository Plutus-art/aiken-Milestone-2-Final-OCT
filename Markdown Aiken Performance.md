# Performance Optimization in Aiken-Lang Smart Contracts

This document highlights performance optimization techniques when writing smart contracts in Aiken-lang for the Cardano blockchain. Aiken-lang, while powerful, requires attention to detail when it comes to execution costs to ensure that your smart contracts remain efficient and scalable.

## 1. Efficient Data Structures

One of the key factors affecting performance in Aiken-lang is the choice of data structures. Using efficient data structures helps reduce the amount of memory and CPU resources consumed during contract execution.

### Example: Use `Map` Instead of Large Lists

Instead of iterating through large lists to find a value, use `Map` data structures that allow for faster lookups.

```aiken
use aiken/Map

// Creating a Map for fast lookups
let nftOwners: Map<string, Address> = Map.empty()

// Inserting an owner into the Map
let updatedNftOwners = Map.insert(nftId, ownerAddress, nftOwners)

// Looking up an owner by nftId
match Map.lookup(nftId, updatedNftOwners) {
    Some(address) -> // Address found
    None -> // Address not found
}
```

### Performance Benefits:
- **Constant Time Lookups**: `Map` offers `O(1)` lookups compared to the `O(n)` complexity of lists.
- **Reduced Memory Footprint**: Using a more compact data structure can help reduce overall memory consumption.

## 2. Minimize On-chain Data Storage

Minimizing the size of data stored on-chain reduces transaction costs and contract execution time. Only store essential data on-chain, while offloading non-essential data to off-chain components.

### Example: Store Hashes Instead of Full Data

```aiken
// Instead of storing the entire metadata, store a hash reference
let metadataHash = hash(metadata)

// Store the hash on-chain
storeMetadataHash(nftId, metadataHash)
```

### Performance Benefits:
- **Lower Transaction Fees**: Storing smaller pieces of data results in reduced fees.
- **Faster Transactions**: The reduced data payload allows for faster validation and inclusion in blocks.

## 3. Optimize Loops

When working with loops, ensure that you minimize unnecessary iterations, as each loop cycle consumes execution resources.

### Example: Avoid Unnecessary List Traversals

Instead of looping through the entire list for each operation, consider refactoring logic to minimize iterations.

```aiken
// Inefficient Loop: Traverses the entire list to find a value
let rec findNft (nftId: string, nfts: List<NFT>) -> Option<NFT> {
    match nfts {
        [] -> None
        nft :: rest -> 
            if nft.id == nftId {
                Some(nft)
            } else {
                findNft(nftId, rest)
            }
    }
}

// Optimized: Refactor using a Map for O(1) lookup
let nft = Map.lookup(nftId, nftMap)
```

### Performance Benefits:
- **Reduced CPU Usage**: Avoid costly list traversals by using `Map` or more efficient algorithms.
- **Improved Execution Time**: This ensures that your contract executes quickly, lowering overall computational costs.

## 4. Leverage Partial Evaluation and Short-Circuiting

Avoid unnecessary computation by utilizing partial evaluation and short-circuiting logic.

### Example: Use Short-Circuiting in Conditional Logic

```aiken
// Instead of evaluating both conditions, short-circuit when the first condition is false
let isValid = nftExists && nftIsNotFrozen

if isValid {
    // Execute logic only if both conditions are true
}
```

### Performance Benefits:
- **Avoids Unnecessary Work**: The contract stops evaluating further once it determines the outcome.
- **Faster Execution**: Reduces overall execution time by skipping irrelevant computations.

## 5. Profile and Test Regularly

Before deploying your Aiken-lang smart contract, always test for performance bottlenecks using the available profiling tools. Measure execution costs and adjust your code to reduce unnecessary complexity.

### Example: Using Cost Estimation Tools

Use the Cardano CLI to simulate transaction costs and optimize accordingly.

```bash
cardano-cli transaction build --cost-mode ...
```

## Conclusion

Optimizing performance in Aiken-lang smart contracts involves making thoughtful decisions around data structures, loops, on-chain storage, and control flow. Following these guidelines will help ensure that your smart contracts are cost-efficient, fast, and scalable on the Cardano blockchain.

By keeping an eye on execution costs and regularly profiling your code, you can make sure that your contracts are as performant as possible.
