In this phase, the smart contract is tested for efficiency under load. This involves simulating a large number of users minting, listing, and buying NFTs simultaneously to ensure the contract scales efficiently.

Passed: If the contract handles multiple simultaneous transactions efficiently with no lag or timeout.
Failed: If there are performance bottlenecks.
Fix: Optimize transaction validation logic, reduce unnecessary state updates, or implement batch processing.
