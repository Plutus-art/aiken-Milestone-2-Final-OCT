# NFT Marketplace Smart Contracts with Aiken

This repository contains smart contracts for an NFT marketplace built on the Cardano blockchain using the **Aiken** language. The marketplace allows users to mint, list, and purchase NFTs, with additional functionality for rewarding buyers using the native token **Plooty (PT)**.

The development process for this marketplace emphasizes reliability, efficiency, and full compatibility with the Cardano ecosystem. Below, we outline the testing process for each feature, including how failures are handled and fixed.

## Features

- **Minting NFTs**: Users can mint unique NFTs with associated metadata.
- **Listing NFTs**: NFTs can be listed for sale at a specified price.
- **Buying NFTs**: Buyers can purchase listed NFTs by transferring the required amount of ADA.
- **Rewards System**: Buyers are rewarded with **Plooty (PT)** tokens after successful purchases.

## Testing Phases

### 1. Feature Design and Specification

Each feature is designed and specified, ensuring a clear understanding of the inputs, outputs, and expected behavior. This includes:
- Defining how minting, listing, buying, and rewards mechanisms should work.
- Anticipating edge cases (e.g., invalid addresses, incorrect payments, or inactive listings).

### 2. Unit Testing (Functionality Verification)

Unit tests ensure each function behaves as expected in isolation. Below are sample test cases for core features.

#### **Minting Feature Test**

```aiken
test fun testMintNFT() {
  let creator = Address.new("addr_test1...");
  let metadata = ByteArray.new("metadata of NFT");
  
  let mintedNFT = NFTMarketplace.mintNFT(creator, metadata);
  
  // Verifying that the NFT is minted with the correct attributes
  assert_eq(mintedNFT.creator, creator);
  assert_eq(mintedNFT.metadata, metadata);
}
```

**Test Case Result:**
- **Passed**: The NFT was created correctly with the appropriate metadata.
- **Failed**: Metadata was incorrectly encoded. Fix by modifying the `mintNFT` function to correctly handle input encoding.

---

#### **Listing Feature Test**

```aiken
test fun testListNFT() {
  let seller = Address.new("addr_test1...");
  let price = Value.lovelace(1000000); // 1 ADA in lovelace

  let nft = NFTMarketplace.mintNFT(seller, ByteArray.new("metadata of NFT"));
  let listing = NFTMarketplace.listNFT(nft, seller, price);

  // Verifying that the listing details are correct
  assert_eq(listing.seller, seller);
  assert_eq(listing.price, price);
  assert(listing.isActive);
}
```

**Test Case Result:**
- **Passed**: The NFT was listed successfully at the correct price.
- **Failed**: Listing was not marked as active due to a state update issue. Fix by reviewing the state transition logic in `listNFT`.

---

#### **Buying Feature Test**

```aiken
test fun testBuyNFT() {
  let seller = Address.new("addr_test1...");
  let buyer = Address.new("addr_test2...");
  let price = Value.lovelace(1000000);

  let nft = NFTMarketplace.mintNFT(seller, ByteArray.new("metadata of NFT"));
  let listing = NFTMarketplace.listNFT(nft, seller, price);

  // Simulating buyer sending correct amount of ADA
  let payment = Value.lovelace(1000000);
  let result = NFTMarketplace.buyNFT(listing, buyer, payment);

  // Verifying that the NFT was transferred to the buyer
  assert(is_ok(result));
  match result {
    Ok(nft) => assert_eq(nft.creator, buyer),
    Err(_) => assert(False, "Failed to buy NFT")
  }
}
```

**Test Case Result:**
- **Passed**: The NFT is transferred to the buyer after successful payment.
- **Failed**: Payment amount mismatch. Fix by adjusting the payment validation logic in `buyNFT`.

---

#### **Rewards Feature Test**

```aiken
test fun testBuyNFTWithRewards() {
  let seller = Address.new("addr_test1...");
  let buyer = Address.new("addr_test2...");
  let price = Value.lovelace(1000000);

  let nft = NFTMarketplace.mintNFT(seller, ByteArray.new("metadata of NFT"));
  let listing = NFTMarketplace.listNFT(nft, seller, price);

  let payment = Value.lovelace(1000000);
  let result = NFTMarketplaceWithRewards.buyNFTWithRewards(listing, buyer, payment);

  // Verifying NFT transfer and reward
  assert(is_ok(result));
  match result {
    Ok((nft, reward)) => {
      assert_eq(nft.creator, buyer);
      assert_eq(reward.amount, Value.new("PT", 1000)); // Buyer should receive 1000 PT
    },
    Err(_) => assert(False, "Failed to buy NFT with rewards")
  }
}
```

**Test Case Result:**
- **Passed**: The buyer received both the NFT and 1000 PT tokens as a reward.
- **Failed**: Incorrect reward amount was distributed. Fix by ensuring proper token calculations in `buyNFTWithRewards`.

### 3. Integration Testing (Interaction Between Features)

Integration tests ensure that multiple features (minting, listing, and buying) work correctly when combined.

```aiken
test fun testIntegrationMintListBuy() {
  let seller = Address.new("addr_test1...");
  let buyer = Address.new("addr_test2...");
  let price = Value.lovelace(1000000);

  // Minting an NFT
  let nft = NFTMarketplace.mintNFT(seller, ByteArray.new("metadata of NFT"));

  // Listing the NFT
  let listing = NFTMarketplace.listNFT(nft, seller, price);
  assert_eq(listing.isActive, True);

  // Buying the NFT
  let payment = Value.lovelace(1000000);
  let result = NFTMarketplace.buyNFT(listing, buyer, payment);

  // Verifying the end-to-end transaction
  assert(is_ok(result));
  match result {
    Ok(nft) => assert_eq(nft.creator, buyer),
    Err(_) => assert(False, "Integration test failed for mint, list, buy")
  }
}
```

**Test Case Result:**
- **Passed**: The mint, list, and buy features worked seamlessly together.
- **Failed**: NFT listing was not deactivated after purchase. Fix by reviewing and correcting state transitions between features.

---

### 4. Performance and Stress Testing

We simulate large numbers of users minting, listing, and buying NFTs simultaneously to ensure scalability.

**Test Case Result:**
- **Passed**: The contract efficiently handled multiple transactions with no lag.
- **Failed**: Performance bottlenecks occurred. Fix by optimizing transaction processing logic and reducing redundant state updates.

---

### 5. Cardano Ecosystem Compatibility Testing

We ensure compatibility with the Cardano blockchain by testing interactions with Cardano wallets and dApps.

**Test Case Result:**
- **Passed**: The smart contract worked seamlessly with Cardano wallets (e.g., Yoroi, Nami).
- **Failed**: Transaction or wallet integration issues. Fix by adjusting transaction logic to adhere to Cardano standards.

---

### 6. Reporting and Fixing Failures

For any feature or test that fails, we document the following:
- **What failed?**: A clear description of the issue.
- **Why did it fail?**: The root cause of the failure.
- **How was it fixed?**: The steps taken to resolve the issue.

Example:
- **Issue**: Incorrect payment amount during NFT purchase.
- **Root Cause**: Payment validation logic failed to properly compare amounts.
- **Fix**: Update the validation function to match exact payment amounts and rerun the test.
