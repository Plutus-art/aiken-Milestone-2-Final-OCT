This phase ensures that the smart contract is fully compatible with the Cardano blockchain. Tests include:

Interoperability: Testing the smart contract with existing Cardano dApps and wallets (e.g., Yoroi, Nami) to ensure transactions are recognized.
Passed: If users can interact seamlessly with Cardano wallets and the contract works as expected on the Cardano testnet.
Failed: If issues arise with transaction processing or wallet integration.
Fix: Modify the contractâ€™s transaction logic to comply with Cardano standards, and retest using updated network parameters.
